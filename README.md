You’re close — the reason links aren’t clickable on GitHub is almost always because the content was pasted **inside a code block** (triple backticks) or the file isn’t `README.md` in the repo root.

Below I give you a **ready-to-paste** README. **Important:** when you paste it into `README.md` **do NOT** include the surrounding triple backticks — paste the raw markdown text so GitHub renders the links.

---

## ✅ Steps to fix (quick)

1. Open (or create) `README.md` in your repo root.
2. Replace its contents with the markdown below (copy **without** the triple backticks).
3. Save, then run:

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Update README with live demo & LinkedIn"
git push
```

4. Open your repo on GitHub — links will be clickable.
