You’re close — the reason links aren’t clickable on GitHub is almost always because the content was pasted **inside a code block** (triple backticks) or the file isn’t `README.md` in the repo root.

Below I give you a **ready-to-paste** README. **Important:** when you paste it into `README.md` **do NOT** include the surrounding triple backticks — paste the raw markdown text so GitHub renders the links.

## ✅ Steps to fix (quick)

1. Open (or create) `README.md` in your repo root.
2. Replace its contents with the markdown below (copy **without** the triple backticks).
3. Save, then run:

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Update README with live demo & LinkedIn"
git push
```

4. Open your repo on GitHub — links will be clickable.

## Copy this entire block **(without the outer triple backticks)** into `README.md`

Got it 👍 let’s fix this properly.

If your README links **aren’t clickable on GitHub**, it’s almost always because:

1. The file isn’t named **`README.md`** (must be exactly that).
2. The markdown is wrapped in **triple backticks (`...`)**, which tells GitHub “treat this as code” → links won’t work.
3. The file is saved as `.txt` or another extension instead of `.md`.

Here’s the **exact text you should paste** (⚠️ DO NOT put backticks before or after it):

✅ After saving:

* Open your repo on GitHub → scroll down → links should be **blue & clickable**.

⚡ Question for you: when you say “not working,” do the links show up as plain text (like just `https://...`) or are they showing but **not clickable**?
